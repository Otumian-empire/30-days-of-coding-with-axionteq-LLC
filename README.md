# 30 days of programming with azionteq LLC
## Why write code for 30 days?
Learning to write a computer code is as much as important as leaning any skill.
Coding or programming is a skill. You must practice daily to really s harpen 
your coding skill. Remember that an apple a day keeps you away from the doctor
 and a program a day keeps you from forgetting the synthax easily. Eventually 
 you'd get used to it.

One of the many solutions to a daily program is available in the `src/` directory.

You don't have to clone this repo, but create your own, solve the daily problems
 and gain your mastery.

## day 1
Write a program to find the distance between point A and B, taken the coordinates of A
and B from the user.
Your code should return 5 for `A(1, 5)` and `B(5, 8)`.
You would need to include the `cmath` and `iostream` library or header files.

## day 2
Write a program, taking a positive integer from the user,
convert the integer to binary, octal and hexadecimal base.
Make use of loops rather.

## day 3
Give a signed, 4-bit binary number, write a program to convert it to its correspoding signed decimal number. Consider the table below for a sample input and output.
Input | Output
------|-------
1100  | -4
0100  | +4

## day 4
Write a program to find the polar coordinate of a given rectangular (cartesian) coordinate.

## day 5
Write a function that takes three reals as arguments and returns the max

## day 6
Implement the bubble sort algorithm

## day 7
Implement the peak algorithm, given an array and its size as argument

## day 8
Implement the linear search algorithm, for a one dimensional array and
and a two dimensional array, gien the array and its size as arguments.
Make use of functions.

## day 9
Implement the factorial algorithm.

## day 10
Given a time elasped in seconds, convert it to hours, minutes anf seconds.
In the format, HH:MM:SS

## day 11

Write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and
lowest temperatures for each month of the year. The program should
output the average high, average low, and the highest and lowest tempera-
tures for the year. Your program must consist of the following functions:

* Function getData : This function reads and stores data in the two-dimensional array.
* Function averageHigh : This function calculates and returns the
average high temperature for the year.
* Function averageLow : This function calculates and returns the aver-
age low temperature for the year.
* Function indexHighTemp : This function returns the index of the
highest high temperature in the array.
* Function indexLowTemp : This function returns the index of the lowest 
low temperature in the array.
(These functions must all have the appropriate parameters.)

## day 12
Implement the min-max-sum algorithm given an array and its size as input.

## day 13
write a program to find the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix, taken an array of of
size 4 as input where the 0th and 1th indexed elements are the first row
and the 2th and 3th indexed elements are the second row.

## day 14
Write a program to the roots of a quadratic equation of the form, ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
taken a, b and c as input.

## day 15
Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the natural numbers divisible by
either 3 or 5, up to a given limit entered by the user.

## day 16
Write a program that, given two positive integers, will calculate and print the greatest
common divisor of the two.

## day 17 
Write a program that, given two positive integers, will calculate and print the lowest
common multiple of the two.

## day 18
Write a program that memics a calculator - takes 2 numerical inputs and an operator.

## day 19
Implement the babylonian algorithm for finding the squareroot of a given number.

## day 20
Implement the binary search algorithm given a sorted array, its size and the search item as input.

## day 21
Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

## day 22
Write a void function that takes arguments, sums the first two and assigns it to the third. (Think a little - address)
