# 30 days of programming with azionteq LLC
## Why 30 write code for 30 days?
Learning to write code is as much as leaning any skill. Coding or programming is a skill.
You must practice daily to really s harpen your coding skill.
Remember that an apple a day keeps you away from the doctor and a program a day keeps you
from forgetting the synthax easily. Eventually you'd get used to it.

One of the many solutions to a daily program is available in the `src/` directory.

## day 1
Write a program to find the distance between point A and B, taken the coordinates of A
and B from the user.
Your code should return 5 for `A(1, 5)` and `B(5, 8)`.
You would need to include the `cmath` and `iostream` library or header files.

## day 2
Write a program, taking a positive integer from the user,
convert the integer to binary, octal and hexadecimal base.
Make use of loops rather.

## day 3
Give a signed, 4-bit binary number, write a program to convert it to its correspoding signed decimal number. Consider the table below for a sample input and output.
Input | Output
------|-------
1100  | -4
0100  | +4

## day 4
Write a program to find the polar coordinate of a given rectangular (cartesian) coordinate.

## day 5
Write a function that takes three reals as arguments and returns the max

## day 6
Implement the bubble sort algorithm

## day 7
Implement the peak algorithm, given an array and its size as argument

## day 8
Implement the linear search algorithm, for a one dimensional array and
and a two dimensional array, gien the array and its size as arguments.
Make use of functions.
